# Tropical Cyclone Diagnostics Package

This repository contains scripts that can be used to analyze and plot model output data from the 
Community Earth System Model (CESM). This pacakage is specifically designed to analyze and plot boundary 
layer processes within modeled tropical cyclones. The scripts are largely generalized, though the user is
expected to replace references to file names and/or paths. Most of the scripts use Python 3.7 with relevant 
packages. The user may need to download certain packages.
